Social Humanoid Robotics Assignment | Cardiff School of Technologies | Cardiff Metropolitan University.


Social Humanoid Robotics project. A 'NAO' robot made to have conversations with the elderly in a care home.
We are developing the 'NAO' robot using 'choregraphe' software and 'QiChat' language. We are developing this program to combat lonliness in elderly care homes.

Instructions to download and run the program are located in 'Instructions' , which can be found [here](Instructions.md)
